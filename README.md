# augur-ossifragae
Data Ingestion System and Repository for Open Source Metrics. Integrates with the augur repository project. 

Note: an Ossifragae is a bearded vulture that is one of a handful of birds said to yield valid signs for ancient Roman Augurs (visionaries) to follow. We think the existance of "OSS" at the beginning of the birds name is a sign. We took it.
